All PHP shell are deobfuscated manually (using my hand and my brain) from many diffrent types of obfuscation like goto, Yak-Pro, eval(, halt_compiler, fopo, ud64, $SISTEMIT_COM_ENC and some others, i've spend like a year to finish this project, so why don't you star and follow me :D, PHP shell are from around the world and will always be updated over time.

## Why i did this?

There are so many PHP shell backdoors that are obfuscated just to cover up that in their code there is a logger that will automatically send the full backdoor shell url, server ip and others to the creator emails or telegram bots, so that the creator can get a shell backdoored website for free, usually the php shell is open-source but some irresponsible people add loggers to it and then obfuscate it and then distribute it for public use, but some are just to protect their code from a skid :p and if there's an error, blank, fix it by your self.

Where did i got all the PHP shell? others github repo, web.archive.org, website that has been hacked, websites that provide php shell download services.

sorry if my english is fucked, i just don't give a fuck.

Missing original shell? or any request to deobfuscate? mail me at *<u><b>bapakgwheker[at]duck.com</b></u>*
